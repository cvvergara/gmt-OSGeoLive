trend2d \- Fit a [weighted] [robust] polynomial model for z = f(x,y) to xyz[w] data.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtrend2d\fP \fB\-F\fP\fBxyzmrw\fP \fB\-N\fP\fIn_model\fP[\fBr\fP] [ \fIxyz[w]file\fP ] 
[ \fB\-C\fP\fIcondition_number\fP ] [ \fB\-H\fP[\fBi\fP][\fInrec\fP] ] [ \fB\-I\fP[\fIconfidence_level\fP] ] [ \fB\-V\fP ] [ \fB\-W\fP ] 
[ \fB\-:\fP[\fBi\fP|\fBo\fP] ] [ \fB\-b\fP[\fBi\fP|\fBo\fP][\fBs\fP|\fBS\fP|\fBd\fP|\fBD\fP[\fIncol\fP]|\fBc\fP[\fIvar1\fP\fB/\fP\fI...\fP]] ] [ \fB\-f\fP[\fBi\fP|\fBo\fP]\fIcolinfo\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtrend2d\fP reads x,y,z [and w] values from the first three [four] columns on standard input 
[or \fIxyz[w]file\fP] and fits a regression model z = f(x,y) + e by [weighted] least squares.  The
fit may be made robust by iterative reweighting of the data.  The user may also search for the number 
of terms in f(x,y) which significantly reduce the variance in z.  n_model may be in [1,10] to fit 
a model of the following form (similar to grdtrend):
.sp
m1 + m2*x + m3*y + m4*x*y + m5*x*x + m6*y*y + m7*x*x*x + m8*x*x*y + m9*x*y*y + m10*y*y*y.
.sp
The user must specify \fB\-N\fP\fIn_model\fP, the number of model parameters to use; 
thus, \fB\-N\fP\fI4\fP fits a bilinear trend, \fB\-N\fP\fI6\fP a quadratic surface, 
and so on.  Optionally, append \fBr\fP to perform a robust fit.  In 
this case, the program will iteratively reweight the data based on a robust scale estimate, 
in order to converge to a solution insensitive to outliers.  This may be handy when separating 
a "regional" field from a "residual" which should have non-zero mean, such as a local mountain 
on a regional surface.
.TP
\fB\-F\fP
Specify up to six letters from the set {x y z m r w} in any order to create columns of 
ASCII [or binary] output.  x = x, y = y, z = z, m = model f(x,y), r = residual z - m, w = weight used in fitting.
.TP
\fB\-N\fP
Specify the number of terms in the model, \fIn_model\fP, and append \fBr\fP 
to do a robust fit.  E.g., a robust bilinear model is \fB\-N\fP\fI4\fP\fBr\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fIxyz[w]file\fP
ASCII [or binary, see \fB\-b\fP] file containing x,y,z [w] values in the first 3 [4] columns.  If no file is specified, \fBtrend2d\fP 
will read from standard input.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
Set the maximum allowed condition number for the matrix solution.  \fBtrend2d\fP 
fits a damped least squares model, retaining only that part of the eigenvalue spectrum such that 
the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue is \fIcondition_#\fP.   
[Default:  \fIcondition_#\fP = 1.0e06. ].
.TP
\fB\-H\fP
Input file(s) has header record(s).  If used, the default number of header records is \fBN_HEADER_RECS\fP.
Use \fB\-Hi\fP if only input data should have header records [Default will write out header records if the
input data have them]. Blank lines and lines starting with # are always skipped.
.TP
\fB\-I\fP
Iteratively increase the number of model parameters, starting at one, until 
\fIn_model\fP is reached or the reduction in variance of the model is not significant at the 
\fIconfidence_level\fP level.  You may set \fB\-I\fP only, without an attached number; in this 
case the fit will be iterative with a default confidence level of 0.51.  Or choose your own level 
between 0 and 1.  See remarks section.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Selects verbose mode, which will send progress reports to stderr [Default runs "silently"].
.TP
\fB\-W\fP
Weights are supplied in input column 4.  Do a weighted least squares fit [or start with these weights 
when doing the iterative robust fit].  [Default reads only the first 3 columns.]
.TP
\fB\-:\fP
Toggles between (longitude,latitude) and (latitude,longitude) input and/or output.  [Default is (longitude,latitude)].
Append \fBi\fP to select input only or \fBo\fP to select output only.  [Default affects both].
.TP
\fB\-bi\fP
Selects binary input.
Append \fBs\fP for single precision [Default is \fBd\fP (double)].
Uppercase \fBS\fP or \fBD\fP will force byte-swapping.
Optionally, append \fIncol\fP, the number of columns in your binary input file
if it exceeds the columns needed by the program.
Or append \fBc\fP if the input file is netCDF. Optionally, append \fIvar1\fP\fB/\fP\fIvar2\fP\fB/\fP\fI...\fP to
specify the variables to be read.
[Default is 3 (or 4 if \fB\-W\fP is set) input columns].
.TP
\fB\-bo\fP
Selects binary output.
Append \fBs\fP for single precision [Default is \fBd\fP (double)].
Uppercase \fBS\fP or \fBD\fP will force byte-swapping.
Optionally, append \fIncol\fP, the number of desired columns in your binary output file.
[Default is 1-6 columns as set by \fB\-F\fP].
.TP
\fB\-f\fP
Special formatting of input and/or output columns (time or geographical data).
Specify \fBi\fP or \fBo\fP to make this apply only to input or output [Default applies to both].
Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
Append \fBT\fP (absolute calendar time), \fBt\fP (relative time in chosen \fBTIME_UNIT\fP since \fBTIME_EPOCH\fP),
\fBx\fP (longitude), \fBy\fP (latitude), or \fBf\fP (floating point) to each column
or column range item.  Shorthand \fB\-f\fP[\fBi\fP|\fBo\fP]\fBg\fP means \fB\-f\fP[\fBi\fP|\fBo\fP]0\fBx\fP,1\fBy\fP
(geographic coordinates).
.SH REMARKS
The domain of x and y will be shifted and scaled to [-1, 1] and the basis functions are built from 
Chebyshev polynomials.  These have a numerical advantage in the form of the matrix which must be 
inverted and allow more accurate solutions.  In many applications of \fBtrend2d\fP the user has data located 
approximately along a line in the x,y plane which makes an angle with the x axis (such as data collected 
along a road or ship track).  In this case the accuracy could be improved by a rotation of the x,y axes.  
\fBtrend2d\fP does not search for such a rotation; instead, it may find that the matrix problem has deficient 
rank.  However, the solution is computed using the generalized inverse and should still work out OK.  
The user should check the results graphically if \fBtrend2d\fP shows deficient rank.  NOTE: The model 
parameters listed with \fB\-V\fP are Chebyshev coefficients; they are not numerically equivalent to the m#s 
in the equation described above.  The description above is to allow the user to match \fB\-N\fP with the 
order of the polynomial surface.  For evaluating Chebyshev polynomials, see \fBgrdmath\fP.
.sp
The \fB\-N\fP\fIn_model\fP\fBr\fP (robust) and \fB\-I\fP (iterative) options evaluate the significance of the improvement 
in model misfit Chi-Squared by an F test.  The default confidence limit is set at 0.51; it can be changed 
with the \fB\-I\fP option.  The user may be surprised to find that in most cases the reduction in variance 
achieved by increasing the number of terms in a model is not significant at a very high degree of 
confidence.  For example, with 120 degrees of freedom, Chi-Squared must decrease by 26% or more to be significant 
at the 95% confidence level.  If you want to keep iterating as long as Chi-Squared is decreasing, set 
\fIconfidence_level\fP to zero.
.sp
A low confidence limit (such as the default value of 0.51) is needed to make the robust method 
work.  This method iteratively reweights the data to reduce the influence of outliers.  The 
weight is based on the Median Absolute Deviation and a formula from Huber [1964], and is 95% 
efficient when the model residuals have an outlier-free normal distribution.  This means that the 
influence of outliers is reduced only slightly at each iteration; consequently the reduction in 
Chi-Squared is not very significant.  If the procedure needs a few iterations to successfully 
attenuate their effect, the significance level of the F test must be kept low.
.SH ASCII FORMAT PRECISION
The ASCII output formats of numerical data are controlled by parameters in
your \.gmtdefaults4 file.  Longitude and latitude are formatted according to
\fBOUTPUT_DEGREE_FORMAT\fP, whereas other values are formatted according
to \fBD_FORMAT\fP.  Be aware that the format in effect can lead to loss of
precision in the output, which can lead to various problems downstream.  If
you find the output is not written with enough precision, consider switching
to binary output (\fB\-bo\fP if available) or specify more decimals using
the \fBD_FORMAT\fP setting.
