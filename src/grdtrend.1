.SH NAME
grdtrend \- Fit and/or remove a polynomial trend in a grid file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgrdtrend\fP \fIgrdfile\fP \fB\-N\fP\fIn_model\fP[\fBr\fP] 
[ \fB\-D\fP\fIdiff.grd\fP ] [ \fB\-T\fP\fItrend.grd\fP ] [ \fB\-V\fP ] 
[ \fB\-W\fP\fIweight.grd\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdtrend\fP reads a 2-D grid file and fits a low-order polynomial
trend to these data by [optionally weighted] least-squares.  The trend surface is 
defined by:
.sp
m1 + m2*x + m3*y + m4*x*y + m5*x*x + m6*y*y + m7*x*x*x + m8*x*x*y + m9*x*y*y + m10*y*y*y.
.sp
The user must specify \fB\-N\fP\fIn_model\fP, the number of model parameters to use; 
thus, \fB\-N\fP\fI4\fP fits a bilinear trend, \fB\-N\fP\fI6\fP a quadratic surface, 
and so on.  Optionally, append \fBr\fP to the \fB\-N\fP option to perform a 
robust fit.  In this case, the program will iteratively reweight the data based on 
a robust scale estimate, in order to converge to a solution insensitive to outliers.  
This may be handy when separating a "regional" field from a "residual" which should 
have non-zero mean, such as a local mountain on a regional surface.
.sp
If data file has values set to NaN, these will be ignored during fitting; if output 
files are written, these will also have NaN in the same locations.
.sp
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
\fIgrdfile\fP
The name of a 2-D binary grid file.
.TP
\fB\-N\fP
[\fBr\fP]\fIn_model\fP sets the number of model parameters to fit.  Append \fBr\fP for robust fit.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP
Write the difference (input data - trend) to the file \fIdiff.grd\fP.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP
Write the fitted trend to the file \fItrend.grd\fP.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Selects verbose mode, which will send progress reports to stderr [Default runs "silently"].
.TP
\fB\-W\fP
If \fIweight.grd\fP exists, it will be read and used to solve a weighted 
least-squares problem.  [Default:  Ordinary least-squares fit.]  If the robust 
option has been selected, the weights used in the robust fit will be written to 
\fIweight.grd\fP.
.SH REMARKS
The domain of x and y will be shifted and scaled to [-1, 1] and the basis functions are built from 
Legendre polynomials.  These have a numerical advantage in the form of the matrix which must be 
inverted and allow more accurate solutions.  NOTE: The model parameters listed with \fB\-V\fP are 
Legendre polynomial coefficients; they are not numerically equivalent to the m#s in the equation 
described above.  The description above is to allow the user to match \fB\-N\fP with the order of the 
polynomial surface.  See \fBgrdmath\fP if you need to evaluate the trend using the reported coefficients. 
.SH GRID FILE FORMATS
By default \fBGMT\fP writes out grid as single precision floats in a COARDS-complaint netCDF file format.
However, \fBGMT\fP is able to produce grid files in many other commonly used grid file formats and also facilitates so called "packing" of grids,
writing out floating point data as 2- or 4-byte integers. To specify the precision, scale and offset, the user should add the suffix
\fB=\fP\fIid\fP[\fB/\fP\fIscale\fP\fB/\fP\fIoffset\fP[\fB/\fP\fInan\fP]], where \fIid\fP is a two-letter identifier of the grid type and precision, and \fIscale\fP and \fIoffset\fP are optional scale factor
and offset to be applied to all grid values, and \fInan\fP is the value used to indicate missing data.
When reading grids, the format is generally automatically recognized. If not, the same suffix can be added to input grid file names.
See \fBgrdreformat\fP(1) and Section 4.17 of the GMT Technical Reference and Cookbook for more information.
.P
When reading a netCDF file that contains multiple grids, \fBGMT\fP will read, by default, the first 2-dimensional grid that can find in that
file. To coax \fBGMT\fP into reading another multi-dimensional variable in the grid file, append \fB?\fP\fIvarname\fP to the file name, where
\fIvarname\fP is the name of the variable. Note that you may need to escape the special meaning of \fB?\fP in your shell program
by putting a backslash in front of it, or by placing the filename and suffix between quotes or double quotes.
The \fB?\fP\fIvarname\fP suffix can also be used for output grids to specify a variable name different from the default: "z".
See \fBgrdreformat\fP(1) and Section 4.18 of the GMT Technical Reference and Cookbook for more information,
particularly on how to read splices of 3-, 4-, or 5-dimensional grids.
