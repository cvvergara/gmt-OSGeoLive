.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsplitxyz\fP reads a series of (x,y[,z]) records [or optionally (x,y,z,d,h); see \fB\-S\fP 
option] from standard input [or \fIxyz[dh]file\fP] and splits this into separate lists 
of (x,y[,z]) series, such that each series has a nearly constant azimuth through the x,y plane.  
There are options to choose only those series which have a certain orientation, to set a 
minimum length for series, and to high\- or low\-pass filter the z values and/or the x,y 
values.  \fBsplitxyz\fP is a useful filter between data extraction and \fBpswiggle\fP plotting, 
and can also be used to divide a large x,y,z dataset into segments.  The output is always
in the ASCII format; input may be ASCII or binary (see \fB\-b\fP).
.TP
\fIxyz[dh]file(s)\fP
3 (but see \fB\-Z\fP) [or 5] column ASCII file [or binary, see \fB\-b\fP] holding (x,y,z[,d,h]) data values.  To use (x,y,z,d,h) input, 
sorted so that d is non-decreasing, specify the \fB\-S\fP option; default expects (x,y,z) only.  
If no file is specified, \fBsplitxyz\fP will read from standard input.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
Terminate a segment when a course change exceeding \fIcourse_change\fP degrees of heading 
is detected.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-A\fP
Write out only those segments which are within +/- \fItolerance\fP degrees of \fIazimuth\fP 
in heading, measured clockwise from North, [0 - 360].  [Default writes all acceptable 
segments, regardless of orientation].
.TP
\fB\-D\fP
Do not write a segment out unless it is at least \fIminimum_distance\fP units long [0]
.TP
\fB\-F\fP
Filter the z values and/or the x,y values, assuming these are functions of d coordinate.  
\fIxy_filter\fP and  \fIz_filter\fP are filter widths in distance units.  If a filter width 
is zero, the filtering is not performed.  The absolute value of the width is the 
full width of a cosine\-arch low\-pass filter.  If the width is positive, the data are 
low\-pass filtered; if negative, the data are high\-pass filtered by subtracting the 
low\-pass value from the observed value.  If \fIz_filter\fP is non\-zero, 
the entire series of input z values is filtered before any segmentation is performed, so 
that the only edge effects in the filtering will happen at the beginning and end of the 
complete data stream.  If \fIxy_filter\fP is non\-zero, the data is first divided into 
segments and then the x,y values of each segment are filtered separately.  This may introduce 
edge effects at the ends of each segment, but prevents a low\-pass x,y filter from rounding 
off the corners of track segments.  [Default = no filtering].
.TP
\fB\-G\fP
Do not let a segment  have a gap exceeding \fIgap_distance\fP; instead, split it into two 
segments.  [Default ignores gaps].
.TP
\fB\-H\fP
Input file(s) has header record(s).  If used, the default number of header records is \fBN_HEADER_RECS\fP.
Use \fB\-Hi\fP if only input data should have header records [Default will write out header records if the
input data have them]. Blank lines and lines starting with # are always skipped.
Not used with binary data.
.TP
\fB\-M\fP
Use Map units.  Then x,y are in degrees of longitude, latitude, distances are
in kilometers, and angles are azimuths.  [Default:  distances are cartesian in same
units as x,y and angles are counter-clockwise from horizontal].
.TP
\fB\-N\fP
Create Named output files, writing each segment to a separate file in the working directory 
named \fInamestem\fP.profile\fI#\fP, where \fI#\fP increases consecutively from 1.  [Default 
writes entire output to stdout, separating segments by sub-headings that start with > marks].
.TP
\fB\-Q\fP
Specify your desired output using any combination of \fIxyzdh\fP, in any order.  Do not space between
the letters.  Use lower case.  The output will be ASCII (or binary, see \fB\-bo\fP) columns of values corresponding 
to \fIxyzdh\fP [Default is \fB\-Q\fP\fIxyzdh\fP (\fB\-Q\fP\fIxydh\fP if \fB\-Z\fP is set)].
.TP
\fB\-S\fP
d and h is supplied.  In this case, input contains x,y,z,d,h.
[Default expects (x,y,z) input, and d,h are computed from delta x, 
delta y, according to \fB\-M\fP option]
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Selects verbose mode, which will send progress reports to stderr [Default runs "silently"].
.TP
\fB\-Z\fP
Data have x,y only (no z-column).
.TP
\fB\-:\fP
Toggles between (longitude,latitude) and (latitude,longitude) input and/or output.  [Default is (longitude,latitude)].
Append \fBi\fP to select input only or \fBo\fP to select output only.  [Default affects both].
.TP
\fB\-bi\fP
Selects binary input.
Append \fBs\fP for single precision [Default is \fBd\fP (double)].
Uppercase \fBS\fP or \fBD\fP will force byte-swapping.
Optionally, append \fIncol\fP, the number of columns in your binary input file
if it exceeds the columns needed by the program.
Or append \fBc\fP if the input file is netCDF. Optionally, append \fIvar1\fP\fB/\fP\fIvar2\fP\fB/\fP\fI...\fP to
specify the variables to be read.
[Default is 2, 3, or 5 input columns as set by \fB\-S\fP, \fB\-Z\fP].
.TP
\fB\-bo\fP
Selects binary output.
Append \fBs\fP for single precision [Default is \fBd\fP (double)].
Uppercase \fBS\fP or \fBD\fP will force byte-swapping.
Optionally, append \fIncol\fP, the number of desired columns in your binary output file.
[Default is 1-5 output columns as set by \fB\-Q\fP].
.TP
\fB\-f\fP
Special formatting of input and/or output columns (time or geographical data).
Specify \fBi\fP or \fBo\fP to make this apply only to input or output [Default applies to both].
Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
Append \fBT\fP (absolute calendar time), \fBt\fP (relative time in chosen \fBTIME_UNIT\fP since \fBTIME_EPOCH\fP),
\fBx\fP (longitude), \fBy\fP (latitude), or \fBf\fP (floating point) to each column
or column range item.  Shorthand \fB\-f\fP[\fBi\fP|\fBo\fP]\fBg\fP means \fB\-f\fP[\fBi\fP|\fBo\fP]0\fBx\fP,1\fBy\fP
(geographic coordinates).
.SH ASCII FORMAT PRECISION
The ASCII output formats of numerical data are controlled by parameters in
your \.gmtdefaults4 file.  Longitude and latitude are formatted according to
\fBOUTPUT_DEGREE_FORMAT\fP, whereas other values are formatted according
to \fBD_FORMAT\fP.  Be aware that the format in effect can lead to loss of
precision in the output, which can lead to various problems downstream.  If
you find the output is not written with enough precision, consider switching
to binary output (\fB\-bo\fP if available) or specify more decimals using
the \fBD_FORMAT\fP setting.
.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose you want to make a wiggle plot of magnetic anomalies on segments oriented 
approximately east\-west from a cruise called cag71 in the region \-R300/315/12/20.  
You want to use a 100km low\-pass filter to smooth the tracks and a 500km high\-pass 
filter to detrend the magnetic anomalies.  Try this:

MGD-77 users: For this application we recommend that you extract d, h from \fBmgd77list\fP rather than
have \fBsplitxyz\fP compute them separately.
