GMT - The Generic Mapping Tools data processing and display software package
			        Version @PACKAGE_VERSION@
			     
GMT is a collection of public-domain Unix tools that allows you to manipulate
x,y and x,y,z data sets (filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.)
and to produce PostScript illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots, via
contour maps, to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D perspective views
in black/white or full color.  Linear, log10, and power scaling are supported
in additon to 25 common map projections.  The processing and display routines
within GMT are completely general and will handle any (x,y) or (x,y,z) data
as input.

The following is a summary of all the programs supplied with GMT and
a very short descriptions of their purpose. Detailed information about each program
can be found in each program's manual page.

Look up the individual man pages for more details and full syntax.
Those man pages are installed in @mandir@/man?.
Information is also available on the GMT World Wide Web home page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu) and, if installed, locally from
@docdir@/html/gmt_services.html.

Default locations of GMT components:
	executables	@bindir@
	library		@libdir@
	shared data	@datadir@
	manual pages	@mandir@/man?
	documentation	@docdir@

The user has control over the following environment variables:

	location of shared data (including subdirectories coast, cpt, etc.):
		GMT_SHAREDIR = ${GMT_SHAREDIR:-@datadir@ (default)}

	user-specific configurations (color tables, .gmtdefaults, etc.):
		GMT_USERDIR = ${GMT_USERDIR:-$HOME/.gmt (default)}

	user-specific data (grids, column data):
		GMT_DATADIR = ${GMT_DATADIR:-(undefined)}

	other deprecated data directories:
		GMT_GRIDDIR = ${GMT_GRIDDIR:-(undefined)}
		GMT_IMGDIR = ${GMT_IMGDIR:-(undefined)}

# OK try to run the command by prefixing the GMT bin path
# The bin path was generated by configure and should thus
# correspond to the dir where GMT binaries were placed
