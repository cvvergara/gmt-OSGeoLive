.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBproject\fP reads arbitrary (\fIx, y\fP[,\fI z\fP]) data from standard input 
[or \fIinfile\fP ] and writes to standard output any combination of 
(\fIx, y, z, p, q, r, s\fP), where (\fIp, q\fP) are the coordinates 
in the projection, (\fIr, s\fP) is the position in the (\fIx, y\fP) coordinate system of 
the point on the profile (\fIq\fP = 0 path) closest to (\fIx, y\fP), and \fIz\fP is
all remaining columns in the input (beyond the required \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP columns).
Alternatively, \fBproject\fP may be used to generate (\fIr, s, p\fP) triples at equal increments \fIdist\fP 
along a profile.  In this case ( \fB\-G\fP option), no input is read.
Projections are defined in any (but only) one of three ways:
(Definition 1)  By a Center \fB\-C\fP and an Azimuth \fB\-A\fP in degrees clockwise from North.
(Definition 2)  By a Center \fB\-C\fP and end point E of the projection path \fB\-E\fP.
(Definition 3)  By a Center \fB\-C\fP and a roTation pole position \fB\-T\fP.
To spherically project data along a great circle path, an oblique coordinate system 
is created which has its equator along that path, and the zero meridian through the 
Center.  Then the oblique longitude (\fIp\fP) corresponds to the distance from the Center 
along the great circle, and the oblique latitude (\fIq\fP) corresponds to the distance 
perpendicular to the great circle path.  When moving in the increasing (\fIp\fP) direction, 
(toward \fIB\fP or in the \fIazimuth\fP direction), the positive (\fIq\fP) direction is to your left.  
If a Pole has been specified, then the positive (\fIq\fP) direction is toward the pole.
.br
To specify an oblique projection, use the \fB\-T\fP option to set the Pole.  Then the 
equator of the projection is already determined and the \fB\-C\fP option is used to locate 
the \fIp\fP = 0 meridian.  The Center \fIcx/cy\fP will be taken as a point through which
the \fIp\fP = 0 meridian passes.  If you do not care to choose a particular point, use the 
South pole (\fIox\fP = 0, \fIoy\fP = -90).
.br
Data can be selectively windowed by using the \fB\-L\fP and \fB\-W\fP options.  If 
\fB\-W\fP is used, the projection Width is set to use only points with 
\fIw_min\fP < q < \fIw_max\fP.  If \fB\-L\fP is set, then the Length is set to use 
only those points with \fIl_min\fP < p < \fIl_max\fP.  If the \fB\-E\fP option 
has been used to define the projection, then \fB\-Lw\fP may be selected to window 
the length of the projection to exactly the span from \fBO\fP to \fBB\fP.
.br
Flat Earth (Cartesian) coordinate transformations can also be made.  Set \fB\-N\fP  
and remember that \fIazimuth\fP is clockwise from North (the \fIy\fP axis), NOT 
the usual cartesian theta, which is counterclockwise from the \fIx\fP axis.  \fIazimuth\fP = 90 - theta. 
.br
No assumptions are made regarding the units for \fIx, y, r, s, p, q, dist, l_min, l_max, w_min, w_max\fP.
If \fB\-Q\fP is selected, map units are assumed and \fIx, y, r, s\fP must be in degrees and
\fIp, q, dist, l_min, l_max, w_min, w_max\fP will be in km.
.br
Calculations of specific great-circle and geodesic distances or for back-azimuths or azimuths are better done using \fBmapproject\fP.
.br
\fBproject\fP is CASE SENSITIVE.  Use UPPER CASE for all one-letter designators which begin optional arguments.  Use 
lower case for the xyzpqrs letters in \fB\-flags\fP. 
.br
.sp
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
\fIcx/cy\fP sets the origin of the projection, in Definition 1 or 2.  If Definition 3 is used (\fB\-T\fP), then
\fIcx/cy\fP are the coordinates of a point through which the oblique zero meridian (\fIp\fP = 0) should pass.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fIinfile\fP
name of ASCII (or binary, see \fB\-bi\fP) file(s) with 2 or more columns holding (x,y,[z]) data values.
If no filenames are given, \fBproject\fP will read from standard input.
If the \fB\-G\fP option is selected, no input data are read.
.TP
\fB\-F\fP
Specify your desired output using any combination of \fIxyzpqrs\fP, in any order.  Do not space between
the letters.  Use lower case.  The output will be ASCII (or binary, see \fB\-bo\fP) columns of values corresponding 
to \fIxyzpqrs\fP [Default].  If both input and output are using ASCII format then the \fIz\fP data are treated as
textstring(s).
If the \fB\-G\fP option is selected, the output will be \fIrsp\fP.
.TP
\fB\-A\fP
\fIazimuth\fP defines the azimuth of the projection (Definition 1).
.TP
\fB\-D\fP
Set the location of the Discontinuity in longitude (\fIr\fP coordinate).  \fB\-Dd\fP will place the
discontinuity at the Dateline, (-180 < \fIr\fP < 180); \fB\-Dg\fP will place it at Greenwich, (0 < \fIr\fP < 360).  
Default usually falls at dateline due to \fIatan2\fP calls.
.TP
\fB\-E\fP
\fIbx/by\fP defines the end point of the projection path (Definition 2).
.TP
\fB\-G\fP
\fIdist\fP Generate mode.  No input is read.  Create (\fIr, s, p\fP) output points every \fIdist\fP units of \fIp\fP.  See 
\fB\-Q\fP option.
.TP
\fB\-H\fP
Input file(s) has header record(s).  If used, the default number of header records is \fBN_HEADER_RECS\fP.
Use \fB\-Hi\fP if only input data should have header records [Default will write out header records if the
input data have them]. Blank lines and lines starting with # are always skipped.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP
Length controls.  Project only those points whose \fIp\fP coordinate is within \fIl_min\fP < \fIp\fP < \fIl_max\fP.  
If \fB\-E\fP has been set, then you may use \fB\-Lw\fP to stay within the distance from \fBC\fP to \fBE\fP.
.TP
\fB\-N\fP
Flat Earth.  Make a Cartesian coordinate transformation in the plane.  [Default uses spherical trigonometry.]
.TP
\fB\-Q\fP
Map type units, i.e., project assumes \fIx, y, r, s\fP are in degrees while
\fIp, q, dist, l_min, l_max, w_min, w_max\fP are in km.  If \fB\-Q\fP is not set, then all these are assumed to be in the same units.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP
Sort the output into increasing \fIp\fP order.  Useful when projecting random data into a sequential profile.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP
\fIpx/py\fP sets the position of the roTation pole of the projection.  (Definition 3).
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Selects verbose mode, which will send progress reports to stderr [Default runs "silently"].
.TP
\fB\-W\fP
Width controls.  Project only those points whose \fIq\fP coordinate is within \fIw_min\fP < \fIq\fP < \fIw_max\fP.  
.TP
\fB\-:\fP
Toggles between (longitude,latitude) and (latitude,longitude) input and/or output.  [Default is (longitude,latitude)].
Append \fBi\fP to select input only or \fBo\fP to select output only.  [Default affects both].
.TP
\fB\-bi\fP
Selects binary input.
Append \fBs\fP for single precision [Default is \fBd\fP (double)].
Uppercase \fBS\fP or \fBD\fP will force byte-swapping.
Optionally, append \fIncol\fP, the number of columns in your binary input file
if it exceeds the columns needed by the program.
Or append \fBc\fP if the input file is netCDF. Optionally, append \fIvar1\fP\fB/\fP\fIvar2\fP\fB/\fP\fI...\fP to
specify the variables to be read.
[Default is 2 input columns].
.TP
\fB\-bo\fP
Selects binary output.
Append \fBs\fP for single precision [Default is \fBd\fP (double)].
Uppercase \fBS\fP or \fBD\fP will force byte-swapping.
Optionally, append \fIncol\fP, the number of desired columns in your binary output file.
[Default is given by \fB\-F\fP or \fB\-G\fP].
.TP
\fB\-f\fP
Special formatting of input and/or output columns (time or geographical data).
Specify \fBi\fP or \fBo\fP to make this apply only to input or output [Default applies to both].
Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
Append \fBT\fP (absolute calendar time), \fBt\fP (relative time in chosen \fBTIME_UNIT\fP since \fBTIME_EPOCH\fP),
\fBx\fP (longitude), \fBy\fP (latitude), or \fBf\fP (floating point) to each column
or column range item.  Shorthand \fB\-f\fP[\fBi\fP|\fBo\fP]\fBg\fP means \fB\-f\fP[\fBi\fP|\fBo\fP]0\fBx\fP,1\fBy\fP
(geographic coordinates).
.TP
\fB\-m\fP
Multiple segment file(s).  Segments are separated by a special record.
For ASCII files the first character must be \fIflag\fP [Default is '>'].
For binary files all fields must be NaN and \fB\-b\fP must
set the number of output columns explicitly.  By default the \fB\-m\fP
setting applies to both input and output.  Use \fB\-mi\fP and \fB\-mo\fP
to give separate settings to input and output.
.SH ASCII FORMAT PRECISION
The ASCII output formats of numerical data are controlled by parameters in
your \.gmtdefaults4 file.  Longitude and latitude are formatted according to
\fBOUTPUT_DEGREE_FORMAT\fP, whereas other values are formatted according
to \fBD_FORMAT\fP.  Be aware that the format in effect can lead to loss of
precision in the output, which can lead to various problems downstream.  If
you find the output is not written with enough precision, consider switching
to binary output (\fB\-bo\fP if available) or specify more decimals using
the \fBD_FORMAT\fP setting.
.SH EXAMPLES
To generate points every 10km along a great circle from 10N,50W to 30N,10W:
.sp
\fBproject\fP \fB\-C\fP-50/10 \fB\-E\fP-10/30 \fB\-G\fP 10 \fB\-Q\fP > great_circle_points.xyp
.sp
(Note that great_circle_points.xyp could now be used as input for \fBgrdtrack\fP, etc. ).
.sp
To project the shiptrack gravity, magnetics, and bathymetry in c2610.xygmb along a great circle through an origin at 30S, 30W, the great circle having 
an azimuth of N20W at the origin, keeping only the data from NE of the profile and within +/- 500 km of the origin, run:
.sp 
\fBproject\fP c2610.xygmb \fB\-C\fP-30/-30 \fB\-A\fP-20 \fB\-W\fP-10000/0 \fB\-L\fP-500/500 \fB\-F\fP pz \fB\-Q\fP > c2610_projected.pgmb
.sp
(Note in this example that \fB\-W\fP-10000/0 is used to admit any value with a large negative \fIq\fP coordinate.  This 
will take those points which are on our right as we walk along the great circle path, or to the NE in this example.)
.sp
To make a Cartesian coordinate transformation of mydata.xy so that the new origin is at 5,3 and the new \fIx\fP axis (\fIp\fP) 
makes an angle of 20 degrees with the old \fIx\fP axis, use:
.sp
\fBproject\fP mydata.xy \fB\-C\fP 5/3 \fB\-A\fP 70 \fB\-F\fP pq > mydata.pq
.sp
To take data in the file pacific.lonlat and transform it into oblique coordinates using a pole from the hotspot reference 
frame and placing the oblique zero meridian (\fIp\fP = 0 line) through Tahiti, run:
.sp
\fBproject\fP pacific.lonlat \fB\-T\fP-75/68 \fB\-C\fP-149:26/-17:37 \fB\-F\fP pq > pacific.pq
.sp
Suppose that pacific_topo.grd is a grid file of bathymetry, and you want to make a file of flowlines in the hotspot reference 
frame.  If you run:
.sp
\fBgrd2xyz\fP pacific_topo.grd | \fBproject\fP \fB\-T\fP-75/68 \fB\-C\fP 0/-90 \fB\-F\fP xyq | \fBxyz2grd\fP 
\fB\-R\fP\fIetc\fP \fB\-I\fP\fIetc\fP \fB\-C\fP flow.grd
.sp
then flow.grd is a file in the same area as pacific_topo.grd, but flow contains the latitudes about the pole of the projection.  
You now can use grdcontour on flow.grd to draw lines of constant oblique latitude, which are flow lines in the hotspot frame.
.br
.sp
If you have an arbitrarily rotation pole \fIpx/py\fP and you would like to draw an oblique small circle on a map, you
will first need to make a file with the oblique coordinates for the small circle (i.e., lon = 0\-360, lat is constant), then create
a file with two records: the north pole (0/90) and the origin (0/0), and find what their oblique coordinates are using your
rotation pole.  Now, use the projected North pole and origin coordinates as the rotation pole and center, respectively,
and project your file as in the pacific example above.  This gives coordinates for an oblique small circle.
