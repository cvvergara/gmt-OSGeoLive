.SH NAME
x2sys_merge \- Merge an updated COEs tables
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBx2sys_merge\fP \fB\-A\fP\fImain_COElist.d\fP \fB\-M\fP\fInew_COElist.d\fP  
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx2sys_merge\fP will read two crossovers data base and output the contents
of the main one updated with the COEs in the second one. The second
file should only contain updated COEs relatively to the first one.
That is, it MUST NOT contain any new two tracks intersections (This point is
NOT checked in the code). This program is useful when, for any good reason like
file editing NAV correction or whatever, one had to recompute only the COEs between
the edited files and the rest of the database.
.TP

\fB\-M\fP
