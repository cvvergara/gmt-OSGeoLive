.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbacktracker\fP reads (longitude, latitude, age) positions from \fIinfiles\fP 
[or standard input] and computes rotated (x,y,t) coordinates using the 
specified rotation parameters.  It can either calculate final
positions [Default] or create a sampled track (flowline or hotspot track) between the initial and final
positions.  The former mode allows additional data fields after the first 3
columns which must have (longitude,latitude,age).
See option \fB\-:\fP on how to read (latitude,longitude,age) files.
.br
	No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.  Use upper case for the
option flags and lower case for modifiers.
.TP
\fIinfile(s)\fP
Data file(s) to be projected.  If not given, standard input is read.
.TP
\fB\-E\fP
Give file with rotation parameters.  This file must contain
one record for each rotation; each record must be of the following format:
.br
.sp
	\fIlon lat tstart [tstop] angle\fP [ \fIkhat a b c d e f g df\fP ]
.br
.sp
where \fItstart\fP and \fItstop\fP are in Myr and \fIlon lat angle\fP are in degrees.
\fItstart\fP and \fItstop\fP are the ages of the old and young ends of a stage.  If \fB\-C\fP is set then a total
reconstruction rotation is expected and \fItstop\fP is implicitly set to 0 and
should not be specified in the file.  If a covariance matrix \fBC\fP for the rotation is available
it must be specified in a format using the nine optional terms listed in brackets.
Here, \fBC\fP = (\fIg\fP/\fIkhat\fP)*[ \fIa b d; b c e; d e f\fP ] which shows \fBC\fP
made up of three row vectors.
If the degrees of freedom (\fIdf\fP) in fitting the rotation is 0 or not given it is set to 10000.
Blank lines and records whose first column contains # will be ignored.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP
Alternatively, specify the longitude, latitude, and opening angle (all in degrees
and separated by /) for a single total reconstruction
rotation that should be applied to all input points.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-A\fP
Used in conjunction with \fB\-Lb\fP|\fBf\fP to limit the track output to those sections
whose predicted ages lie between the specified \fIyoung\fP and \fIold\fP limits.  If \fB\-LB\fP|\fBF\fP
is used instead then the limits apply to the stage ids (id 1 is the youngest stage).  If no limits are specified
then individual limits for each record are expected in columns 4 and 5 of the input file.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
Expect Total Reconstruction Rotations rather than Forward Stage Rotations [Default].
File format is similar to the stage pole format except that the \fItstart\fP column
is not present (assumed to be 0 Ma).  Requires \fB\-E\fP.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP
Set the direction to go: \fB\-Df\fP will go backward in time (from younger to older positions), while
\fB\-Db\fP will go forward in time (from older to younger positions) [Default].  Note: For \fB\-Db\fP you
are specifying the age at the given location, whereas for \fB\-Df\fP
you are not; instead you specify the age at the reconstructed point.
.TP
\fB\-F\fP
Supply a file with lon, lat, age records that contains the history of hotspot motion for the current hotspot.  If given,
the reconstructions will only use the 3rd data input column (i.e., the age) to obtain the location
of the hotspot at that time, via an interpolation of the hotspot motion history.  This adjusted
location is then used to reconstruct the point or path [No drift].
.TP
\fB\-H\fP
Input file(s) has header record(s).  If used, the default number of header records is \fBN_HEADER_RECS\fP.
Use \fB\-Hi\fP if only input data should have header records [Default will write out header records if the
input data have them]. Blank lines and lines starting with # are always skipped.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP
Specify a sampled path between initial and final position: \fB\-Lf\fP will
draw particle flowlines, while \fB\-Lb\fP will draw backtrack (hotspot track) paths.
Append sampling interval in km.  If \fIstep\fP < 0 then only the rotation times
will be returned.  When \fB\-LF\fP or \fB\-LB\fP is used, the
third output column will contain the stage id (1 is youngest) [Default is
along-track predicted ages].  You can control the direction of the paths
by using \fB\-D\fP.
.TP
\fB\-N\fP
Set the maximum age to extend the oldest stage rotation back in time [Default is no extension].
.TP
\fB\-Q\fP
Assign a fixed age to all positions.  Only lon, lat input is expected [Default expects longitude, latitude, age].
Useful when the input are points defining isochrons.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP
When \fB\-L\fP is set, the tracks are normally written to stdout as a multisegment
file.  Specify a \fIfilestem\fP to have each track written to \fIfilestem.#\fP, where
\fI#\fP is the track number.  The track number is also copied to the 4th output column.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP
Set the current time [Default is 0 Ma].
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Selects verbose mode, which will send progress reports to stderr [Default runs "silently"].
.TP
\fB\-W\fP
Rotates the given input (lon,lat,t) and calculates the confidence ellipse for the
projected point.  The input point \fImust\fP have a time coordinate that exactly matches
a particular finite rotation time, otherwise the point will be skipped.  Append
\fBt\fP or \fBa\fP to output time or angle, respectively, after the projected
lon, lat.  After these 2-3 items, we write azimuth, major, minor (in km) for the
95% confidence ellipse.  See \fB\-D\fP for the direction of rotation.
.TP
\fB\-:\fP
Toggles between (longitude,latitude) and (latitude,longitude) input and/or output.  [Default is (longitude,latitude)].
Append \fBi\fP to select input only or \fBo\fP to select output only.  [Default affects both].
.TP
\fB\-bi\fP
Selects binary input.
Append \fBs\fP for single precision [Default is \fBd\fP (double)].
Uppercase \fBS\fP or \fBD\fP will force byte-swapping.
Optionally, append \fIncol\fP, the number of columns in your binary input file
if it exceeds the columns needed by the program.
Or append \fBc\fP if the input file is netCDF. Optionally, append \fIvar1\fP\fB/\fP\fIvar2\fP\fB/\fP\fI...\fP to
specify the variables to be read.
[Default is 3 input columns].
.TP
\fB\-bo\fP
Selects binary output.
Append \fBs\fP for single precision [Default is \fBd\fP (double)].
Uppercase \fBS\fP or \fBD\fP will force byte-swapping.
Optionally, append \fIncol\fP, the number of desired columns in your binary output file.
[Default depends on settings].
.TP
\fB\-m\fP
Multiple segment file(s).  Segments are separated by a special record.
For ASCII files the first character must be \fIflag\fP [Default is '>'].
For binary files all fields must be NaN and \fB\-b\fP must
set the number of output columns explicitly.  By default the \fB\-m\fP
setting applies to both input and output.  Use \fB\-mi\fP and \fB\-mo\fP
to give separate settings to input and output.
.SH EXAMPLES
To backtrack the (x,y,t) points in the file seamounts.d to their origin
(presumably the hotspot), using the DC85.d Euler poles, run
.br
.sp
\fBbacktracker\fP seamounts.d \fB\-Db\fP \fB\-E\fP DC85.d > newpos.d
.br
.sp
To project flowlines forward from the (x,y,t) points stored in several 3-column,
binary, double precision files, run
.br
.sp
\fBbacktracker\fP points.* \fB\-Df\fP \fB\-E\fP DC85.d \fB\-Lf\fP 25 \fB\-bo\fP \fB\-bi\fP\fI3\fP > lines.b
.br
.sp
This file can then be plotted with \fBpsxy \-M\fP.
.br
.sp
To compute the predicted Hawaiian hotspot track from 0 to 80 Ma every 1 Ma, given a history of
hotspot motion file (HIdrift.txt) and a set of total reconstruction rotations for the plate (PAC_APM.d), try
.br
.sp
echo 204 19 80 | \fBbacktracker\fP \fB\-Df\fP \fB\-C\fP \fB\-E\fP PAC_APM.d \fB\-Lb\fP 1 > path.d
.SH COORDINATES
Data coordinates are assumed to be geodetic and will automatically be converted to geocentric
before spherical rotations are performed.  We convert back to geodetic coordinates for output.
Note: If your data already are geocentric, you can avoid the conversion by using --ELLIPSOID=sphere.
