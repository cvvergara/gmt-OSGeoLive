\fB\-G\fP\fIoutput_file\fP [ \fB\-I\fP\fIxinc\fP[\fIunit\fP][\fB=\fP|\fB+\fP][/\fIyinc\fP[\fIunit\fP][\fB=\fP|\fB+\fP]] ] [ \fB\-N\fP\fBi\fP|\fBp\fP|\fBr\fP ] [ \fB\-R\fP\fIwest\fP/\fIeast\fP/\fIsouth\fP/\fInorth\fP[\fBr\fP] ] [ \fB\-T\fP ] [ \fB\-V\fP ] [ \fB\-f\fP[\fBi\fP|\fBo\fP]\fIcolinfo\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdfilter\fP will filter a \fI.grd\fP file in the time domain using one
of the selected convolution or non-convolution isotropic filters and
compute distances using Cartesian or Spherical geometries.
The output \fI.grd\fP file can optionally be generated as a
subOPT(R)egion of the input and/or with a new \fB\-I\fP ncrement.  In this
way, one may have "extra space" in the input data so that the
edges will not be used and the output can be within one-half-
width of the input edges.  If the filter is low-pass, then the
output may be less frequently sampled than the input.
.TP
\fIinput_file\fP
The grid file of points to be filtered.
(See GRID FILE FORMATS below).
.TP
\fB\-D\fP
Distance \fIflag\fP tells how grid (x,y) relates to filter \fIwidth\fP as follows:
.sp
\fIflag\fP = 0:  grid (x,y) same units as \fIwidth\fP, Cartesian distances.
.br
\fIflag\fP = 1:  grid (x,y) in degrees, \fIwidth\fP in kilometers, Cartesian distances.
.br
\fIflag\fP = 2:  grid (x,y) in degrees, \fIwidth\fP in km, dx scaled by cos(middle y), Cartesian distances.
.sp
The above options are fastest because they allow weight matrix to be computed only once.
The next three options are slower because they recompute weights for each latitude.
.sp
\fIflag\fP = 3:  grid (x,y) in degrees, \fIwidth\fP in km, dx scaled by cosine(y), Cartesian distance calculation.
.br
\fIflag\fP = 4:  grid (x,y) in degrees, \fIwidth\fP in km, Spherical distance calculation.
.br
\fIflag\fP = 5:  grid (x,y) in Mercator -Jm1 img units, \fIwidth\fP in km, Spherical distance calculation.
.TP
\fB\-F\fP
Sets the filter type.  Choose among convolution and non-convolution filters.  Append the filter code followed
by the full diameter \fIwidth\fP. Available convolution filters are:
.br
(\fBb\fP) Boxcar: All weights are equal.
.br
(\fBc\fP) Cosine Arch: Weights follow a cosine arch curve.
.br
(\fBg\fP) Gaussian: Weights are given by the Gaussian function, where \fIwidth\fP is 6 times the
conventional Gaussian sigma.
.br
Non-convolution filters are:
.br
(\fBm\fP) Median: Returns median value.
.br
(\fBp\fP) Maximum likelihood probability (a mode estimator): Return modal value.
If more than one mode is found we return their average value.  Append - or + to
the filter width if you rather want to return the smallest or largest of the modal
values.
.br
(\fBl\fP) Lower: Return the minimum of all values.
.br
(\fBL\fP) Lower: Return minimum of all positive values only.
.br
(\fBu\fP) Upper: Return maximum of all values.
.br
(\fBU\fP) Upper: Return maximum or all negative values only.
.br
In the case of \fBL\fP|\fBU\fP it is possible that no data passes the initial sign test; in that case
the filter will return 0.0.
.TP
\fB\-G\fP
\fIoutput_file\fP is the output grid file of the filter.
(See GRID FILE FORMATS below).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-I\fP
\fIx_inc\fP [and optionally \fIy_inc\fP] is the output Increment. Append \fBm\fP to indicate minutes, or \fBc\fP to indicate seconds.
If  the new \fIx_inc, y_inc\fP are NOT integer multiples of the old ones (in the input data), filtering will be considerably slower.
[Default:  Same as input.]
.TP
\fB\-N\fP
Determine how NaN-values in the input grid affects the filtered outout:  Append \fBi\fP to ignore all NaNs in
the calculation of filtered value [Default], \fBr\fP is same as \fBi\fP except if the input node was NaN then the
output node will be set to NaN (only applies if both grids are coregistered), and \fBp\fP which will
force the filtered value to be NaN if any grid-nodes with NaN-values are found inside the filter circle.
.TP
\fB\-R\fP
\fIwest, east, south, \fPand \fInorth\fP defines the Region of the output points.  [Default:  Same as input.]
.TP
\fB\-T\fP
Toggle the node registration for the output grid so as to become the opposite of the input grid
[Default gives the same registration as the input grid].
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Selects verbose mode, which will send progress reports to stderr [Default runs "silently"].
.TP
\fB\-f\fP
Special formatting of input and/or output columns (time or geographical data).
Specify \fBi\fP or \fBo\fP to make this apply only to input or output [Default applies to both].
Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
Append \fBT\fP (absolute calendar time), \fBt\fP (relative time in chosen \fBTIME_UNIT\fP since \fBTIME_EPOCH\fP),
\fBx\fP (longitude), \fBy\fP (latitude), or \fBf\fP (floating point) to each column
or column range item.  Shorthand \fB\-f\fP[\fBi\fP|\fBo\fP]\fBg\fP means \fB\-f\fP[\fBi\fP|\fBo\fP]0\fBx\fP,1\fBy\fP
(geographic coordinates).
.SH GRID FILE FORMATS
By default \fBGMT\fP writes out grid as single precision floats in a COARDS-complaint netCDF file format.
However, \fBGMT\fP is able to produce grid files in many other commonly used grid file formats and also facilitates so called "packing" of grids,
writing out floating point data as 2- or 4-byte integers. To specify the precision, scale and offset, the user should add the suffix
\fB=\fP\fIid\fP[\fB/\fP\fIscale\fP\fB/\fP\fIoffset\fP[\fB/\fP\fInan\fP]], where \fIid\fP is a two-letter identifier of the grid type and precision, and \fIscale\fP and \fIoffset\fP are optional scale factor
and offset to be applied to all grid values, and \fInan\fP is the value used to indicate missing data.
When reading grids, the format is generally automatically recognized. If not, the same suffix can be added to input grid file names.
See \fBgrdreformat\fP(1) and Section 4.17 of the GMT Technical Reference and Cookbook for more information.
.P
When reading a netCDF file that contains multiple grids, \fBGMT\fP will read, by default, the first 2-dimensional grid that can find in that
file. To coax \fBGMT\fP into reading another multi-dimensional variable in the grid file, append \fB?\fP\fIvarname\fP to the file name, where
\fIvarname\fP is the name of the variable. Note that you may need to escape the special meaning of \fB?\fP in your shell program
by putting a backslash in front of it, or by placing the filename and suffix between quotes or double quotes.
The \fB?\fP\fIvarname\fP suffix can also be used for output grids to specify a variable name different from the default: "z".
See \fBgrdreformat\fP(1) and Section 4.18 of the GMT Technical Reference and Cookbook for more information,
particularly on how to read splices of 3-, 4-, or 5-dimensional grids.
.SH GEOGRAPHICAL AND TIME COORDINATES
When the output grid type is netCDF, the coordinates will be labeled "longitude", "latitude", or "time" based on the
attributes of the input data or grid (if any) or on the
\fB\-f\fP or \fB\-R\fP options. For example, both \fB\-f0x\fP \fB\-f1t\fP and \fB\-R\fP 90w/90e/0t/3t will result in a longitude/time
grid. When the x, y, or z coordinate is time, it will be stored in the grid as relative time since epoch as 
specified by \fBTIME_UNIT\fP and \fBTIME_EPOCH\fP in the \.gmtdefaults file or on the command line.
In addition, the \fBunit\fP attribute of the time variable will indicate both this unit and epoch.
.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose that north_pacific_dbdb5.grd is a file of 5 minute bathymetry from 140E to 260E and 0N to 50N, and you want to find
the medians of values within a 300km radius (600km full width) of the output points, which you choose to be from 150E to 250E
and 10N to 40N, and you want the output values every 0.5 degree.  Using spherical distance calculations, you need:
.sp
\fBgrdfilter\fP north_pacific_dbdb5.grd \fB\-G\fP filtered_pacific.grd \fB\-Fm\fP 600 \fB\-D\fP 4 \fB\-R\fP 150/250/10/40 \fB\-I\fP 0.5 \fB\-V\fP
.SH LIMITATIONS
When working with geographic (lat, lon) grids, all three convolution filters (boxcar, cosine arch, and gaussian) will properly normalize
the filter weights for the variation in gridbox size with latitude, and correctly determine which nodes are needed for the convolution
when the filter "circle" crosses a periodic (0-360) boundary or contains a geographic pole.  However, the spatial filters, such as median and mode filters,
do not use weights and thus should only be used on Cartesian grids (or at very low latitudes) only.  If you want to apply such spatial
filters you should project your data to an equal-area projection and run grdfilter on the resulting Cartesian grid.
.br
To use the \fB\-D\fP 5 option the input Mercator grid must be created by img2mercgrd using the \fB\-C\fP option so the origin of the
y-values is the Equator (i.e., x = y = 0 correspond to lon = lat = 0).
