gmt (4.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Starting from 4.5.2 a new format of coastline data is required, i.e. 
    GSHHS 2.0.2 (or higher). It implies that current high/full coastline data
    version (as available on the official ftp site) is not back-compatible.
    You need to use 2.0.1 with any GMT version <= 4.5.1.
